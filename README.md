This is the *Git Internals* project I made myself.


<p>Widely used in industry and education, Git is probably the most popular and convenient source control system today. You only need to know a few Git CLI commands for this project, or you can use Git with the GUI wrapper. You don’t need to know what happens under the hood of Git when everything is working as it should, but if something goes wrong it is very difficult to find a solution without knowing the underlying logic.</p>
